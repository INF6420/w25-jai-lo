        <h2>ABOUT THE ARCHIVE</h2> <br/>
        <p>In recent years, I have become really interested in personal publications like zines, blogs, and other art publication ventures.
            I made this space to compile zines that inspire me, that I have personally made, and that relate to my life right now.
