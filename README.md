# Jaimie's INF 6420 Zine Library

A webarchive of zines I currently find relevant to my life, including zines made by friends, zines about things I'm learning at Wayne, and zines about textile crafts.  Additionally, this project will contain zine-making instructions and resources for people new to zine making.

Subheader ### H3 - About me title

Main content - the main content will include a description about me and my methods in curating and finding zines for this archive site.  Additionally, i may include some information about copyright and creative commons here about the use and distribution of these zines
I will also include a section titled 'what are zines' with information about the creation of zines, their historical uses, and a tutorial on zine creation.  Potentially could include a youtube video player with a playlist of zine-focused content creators.

Main content - this will include an 8 rectangle layout of zine in the collection.  each rectangle will have an image preview of the zine.  when you hover over the zine pages, the rectangle will darken and display the zine's title and the zine's author name.

Other potential ideas include a page where people can find zines by theme
